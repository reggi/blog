# Blog

---

I really want to create a blog, that I actually use. I created the latest version of [reggi.com](http://reggi.com) when I graduated college, it was created for a very specific purpose, to get a job. Now that i've been happily employed for over a year now, I think that it's time to give my website a facelift.

I wan't to incorperate in the update to reggi.com a new blog, and I don't want to use wordpress. I want to use what I use, the same tools that I use on a daily basis as a developer, [sublime text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), [mou](http://mouapp.com/), [github](https://github.com/), [git](http://git-scm.com/), and [terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X\)).

What is important to me in reggi v.4.0?
